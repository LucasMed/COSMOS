I"$	<p>This document describes how to secure a COSMOS installation.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>COSMOS is primarily secured by properly configuring settings with the system.txt configuration file.  The following settings are important.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Setting</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Recommended Settings</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>X_CSRF_TOKEN</td>
      <td>This is a secret value included in all API requests.</td>
      <td>Change this from the default to something different for each project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LISTEN_HOST</td>
      <td>These settings define if TCP/IP servers opened by COSMOS accept connections from just localhost (127.0.0.1), or external connections (0.0.0.0)</td>
      <td>It is recommended to leave these all set at 127.0.0.1 unless you need to allow external access</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ALLOW_HOST</td>
      <td>Adds to the list of allowed hosts in the HTTP Host header of COSMOS API requests. Defaults to just localhost:7777, localhost:7778, etc.</td>
      <td>To allow connections to COSMOS APIs from external computers you will need to add YourCOSMOSServerIP:7777, YourCOSMOSServerIP:7778, etc.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ALLOW_ORIGIN</td>
      <td>Used to specify websites that are allowed to access COSMOS.  Default to None.</td>
      <td>Add the hostname and port of websites that should be allowed to access the COSMOS API. Typically None</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ALLOW_ACCESS</td>
      <td>Specifies hosts (IP Addresses) that are allowed to connect</td>
      <td>This setting still defaults to ALL, but for enhanced security, only allow connections from expected external computers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>ALLOW_ROUTER_COMMANDING</td>
      <td>Allows COSMOS routers to accept commands and forward them to interfaces.</td>
      <td>It is recommended that you do NOT include this line in your system.txt file unless you need to send commands through routers (such as some CmdTlmServer chaining use cases)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Setting the above settings correctly will provide a relatively secure COSMOS installation.
