I"Å<p>This document describes the COSMOS logging framework and structure.</p>

<p>The COSMOS system creates a number of different logs both for data and for application events. The log file location is defined in the system.txt file by the <a href="/docs/system/#path">‚ÄòPATH LOGS‚Äô</a> setting. The log files which get created in this directory follow a common naming convention. The first part is a date and time: YYYY<em>MM_DD_HH_MM_SS</em>. This is followed by words specific to the COSMOS application. COSMOS applications produce the following logs:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Application</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Any</td>
      <td>&lt;date&gt;_exception.txt</td>
      <td>Exception file which is generated if a COSMOS application crashes. Any user provided interface code, background tasks, conversions, etc can result in an exception file if not properly written.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Any</td>
      <td>&lt;date&gt;_unexpected.txt</td>
      <td>Unexpected text output. If user code tries to print to the standard output using ‚Äòputs‚Äô, this output is captured and an unexpected log file is created when the application exits.</td>

<h1 id="binary-file-structure">Binary File Structure</h1>

<p>The Command and Telemetry Server binary log files contain command and telemetry packets. Each log file starts with a 128 byte header that is used internally by COSMOS to denote the version of definition files that were used when the file was created.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Item</td>
      <td>Data Type</td>
      <td>Description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Marker</td>
      <td>8 byte ASCII String</td>
      <td>The ASCII string ‚ÄòCOSMOS2*‚Äô</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type</td>
      <td>4 byte ASCII String</td>
      <td>Either ‚ÄòCMD*‚Äô for command logs or ‚ÄòTLM_‚Äô for Telemetry logs</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>MD5</td>
      <td>32 byte ASCII String</td>
      <td>32 byte MD5 Sum calculated over the configuration files being used</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Underscore</td>
      <td>1 byte ASCII String</td>
      <td>An Underscore character</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Hostname</td>
      <td>83 byte ASCII String</td>
      <td>Left justified hostname of the computer that created the file</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The file header is followed by command or telemetry packets (depending on the log type), each with a Big Endian header as follows. Note this is the same binary header used by the preidentified streaming protocol:</p>

    <tr>

      <td>8-bit unsigned integer</td>
      <td>0x80 indicates whether the data is stored telemetry (see below). 0x40 indicates there is extra data following this byte. 0x3F bits are currently undefined. (since 4.3.0)</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Target Name</td>
      <td>Variable length ASCII String</td>
      <td>String that indicates the name of the target that the data was sourced from.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Packet Name Length</td>
      <td>8-bit unsigned integer</td>
      <td>Length in bytes of the packet name</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Packet Name</td>
      <td>Variable length ASCII String</td>
      <td>String that indicates the name of the packet of data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Packet Length</td>
      <td>32-bit unsigned big endian integer</td>
      <td>Length in bytes of the packet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Packet</td>
      <td>Variable length block of data</td>
      <td>The binary data packet (endianness defined by packet definition)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The variable length nature of command and telemetry packets requires a log parser to start from the beginning of each log file when processing packets.</p>

<p>If the Write Flags indicate the data is stored telemetry (MSB set) COSMOS processes and stores the data in the telemetry log file but does not update the current value table. Thus stored telemetry does not affect displays or scripts.</p>
