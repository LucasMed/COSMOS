<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Docker - Running COSMOS 5 requires a working Docker installation.  Typically Docker Desktop on Windows / Mac.  Plain docker should work on linux.  Weâ€™re currently only developing / running with Docker Desktop on Windows, so if you have any issues on another platform, please let us know by submitting a ticket!</li>
</ul>

<p>Minimum Resources allocated to Docker: 4GB RAM, 1 CPU, 60GB Disk
Recommended Resources allocated to Docker: 8GB RAM, 2+ CPUs, 100GB Disk</p>

<h3 id="to-run">To Run:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Download one of the archives (.zip or .tar.gz from the Github release page) <a href="https://github.com/BallAerospace/COSMOS/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha.1">Download Release Here</a></li>
  <li>Extract the archive somewhere on your host computer</li>
  <li>The COSMOS 5 containers are designed to work and be built in the presence of an SSL Decryption device.  To support this a cacert.pem file can be placed at the base of the COSMOS 5 project that includes any certificates needed by your organization.  If you donâ€™t need this, then please ignore, but if you see any SSL errors, this is probably why.</li>
  <li>Run cosmos_start.bat (Windows), or cosmos_start.sh (linux/Mac)</li>
  <li>COSMOS 5 will be built and when ready should be running (~15 mins for first run, ~2 for subsequent)</li>
  <li>Connect a web browser to http://localhost:8080</li>
  <li>Have fun trying out COSMOS 5!</li>
</ol>

<p>Please try it out and let us know what you think!  Please submit any issues as Github tickets, or any generic feedback to COSMOS@ball.com.</p>

<p>Note that this release is not ready for production use.  We will have a more beta ready release in a few months.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
