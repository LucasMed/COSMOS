I"S<p>This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to COSMOS. We’ll cover topics such
as getting your configuration up and running, developing test and operations scripts,
building custom telemetry screens, and give you some advice on participating in the future
development of COSMOS itself.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-ball-aerospace-cosmos-exactly">So what is Ball Aerospace COSMOS, exactly?</h2>

<p>COSMOS is a suite of applications that can be used to control a set of embedded systems. These systems can be
anything from test equipment (power supplies, oscilloscopes, switched power strips, UPS devices, etc), to
development boards (Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, Beaglebone, etc), to satellites.</p>
