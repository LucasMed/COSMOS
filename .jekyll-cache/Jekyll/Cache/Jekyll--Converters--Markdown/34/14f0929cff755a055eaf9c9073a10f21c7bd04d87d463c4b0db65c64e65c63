I"´<p>There are two ways to chain CmdTlmServers to achieve two distinctly different results. One is to chain a client CmdTlmServer to a master to enable a separate workstation to have access to all the command and telemetry. The second is to connect a master CmdTlmServer to a client to allow a remote client to act as an interface to a target. Both methods will be discussed here.</p>

<h2 id="chain-client-cmdtlmserver-to-master">Chain Client CmdTlmServer to Master</h2>

<p>Chaining a client CmdTlmServer to a master CmdTlmServer allows for running the COSMOS tools on other workstations and removing that processing load from a master CmdTlmServer that is directly connected to your targets. This is great for setting up workstations dedicated to graphing data, or viewing telemetry, without disturbing the main operation as the client will get all the same information as the master CmdTlmServer.</p>

<h3 id="master-cmdtlmserver-configuration">Master CmdTlmServer Configuration</h3>

<p>The default COSMOS Configuration already includes everything necessary to chain ‚Äúchild‚Äù CmdTlmServers. There is a default router called the PREIDENTIFIED_ROUTER that is listening on port 7779 by default. This is used to chain CmdTlmServers and is also used by TlmGrapher to access the full telemetry stream.</p>

<p>The only issue on the master CmdTlmServer computer is that you must make sure that the firewall is either disabled or that access to port 7779 is permitted.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the example cmd_tlm_server_chain.txt file below
    <ul>
      <li>Change localhost to the IP address of your master CmdTlmServer</li>
      <li>Update the TARGET keywords to include all of your targets</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Put the updated cmd_tlm_server_chain.txt into config/tools/cmd_tlm_server/cmd_tlm_server_chain.txt</li>
  <li>Start CmdTlmServer with (probably create a modified launcher.txt and associated .bat file):
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ruby CmdTlmServer --config cmd_tlm_server_chain.txt</code></li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="connect-master-cmdtlmserver-to-client">Connect Master CmdTlmServer to Client</h2>

<p>Connecting a master CmdTlmServer to a client CmdTlmServer is used when a client machine needs to interface directly to a target but the master CmdTlmServer also wants to view that target. For example, a machine is physically located next to a target which requires a serial interface (thus a serial cord connection) but the master CmdTlmServer is across the room. This technique connects the local machine to the target and then connects the master CmdTlmServer to the client. The client doesn‚Äôt need to define the full configuration of the server and only has to configure the local target it is interfacing with. This technique can also be used to create multiple CmdTlmServers on the same machine. This is useful if you‚Äôre experimenting with a target or background task and doing things that make the CmdTlmServer unstable.</p>

<h3 id="child-cmdtlmserver-configuration-1">Child CmdTlmServer Configuration</h3>

<p>The child COSMOS configuration should be configured as a totally stand alone COSMOS system. Follow the rest of the COSMOS documentation to set up the command and telemetry definitions and the interface definition in the target‚Äôs cmd_tlm_server.txt file. When this is complete, you will have a config/targets/&lt;TARGET&gt; folder with your target‚Äôs definition. Note that if you‚Äôre creating a client CmdTlmServer on the same machine you‚Äôll need to adjust all the standard COSMOS ports in system.txt.</p>

<p>The client CmdTlmServer defines a default router called the PREIDENTIFIED_ROUTER that is listening on port 7779 by default. This will be used by the master CmdTlmServer to connect. Ensure that the firewall is either disabled or that access to port 7779 is permitted.</p>

<h3 id="master-cmdtlmserver-configuration-1">Master CmdTlmServer Configuration</h3>

<p>The master config/tools/cmd_tlm_server/cmd_tlm_server.txt file is where you define the interface to connect to the child CmdTlmServer.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modify the example cmd_tlm_server.txt file below
    <ul>
      <li>Change localhost to the IP address of your client CmdTlmServer if the client is another machine</li>
      <li>Change the port numbers if the client is running on the same machine</li>
      <li>Update &lt;TARGET&gt; to match the target name from the client</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure your system.txt file has either AUTO_DECLARE_TARGETS or explictly declares the target via DECLARE_TARGET &lt;TARGET&gt;</li>
  <li>Ensure your config/targets/&lt;TARGET&gt; folder matches the target definition on the client
    <ul>
      <li>Since the child and master CmdTlmServer share the same target definition, it is convenient to make this target an SVN external in one of the COSMOS configurations to ensure consistency between them</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
